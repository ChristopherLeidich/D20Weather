                            &#39;Woods can either describe an Assortment of Trees or a wild Untamed Land of Dangers. &#39;
                            &#39;To this Day Most Adventurers meet their Untimely End in Forests Either by Starvation &#39;
                            &#39;due to misdirection or by one &#39;
                            &#39;of its countless Inhabitants.&#39;,

                                  &#39;but also in the Fauna itself. Under-bushes, Plants toxic to the Touch and &#39;
                                  &#39;brambles make the Traversal of such Areas an equally big Challenge as Deserts or Glaciers at Times.&#39;,

                      &#39;Traversing such an Area counts as Difficult Terrain. Additionally on the First Movement-Action into such an Area &#39;
                      &#39;every Creature must make a DC15 Reflex Save.\n On a Failure They become Immobilised until the Start of their next &#39;

      regionalName: &#39;Desert&#39;,
      regionalDescription:  &#39;A desert is a landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, &#39;

                            &#39;the Ability to survive in such an environment and most of them are natural predators &#39;
                            &#39;because feeding on each other is in most cases easier than fighting for the scarce &#39;
                            &#39;amount of Plants. Due to this the Aslanti had the word &quot;dēsertum&quot; for such a place &#39;
                            &#39;which means translated in to common &quot;the abandoned place&quot; or &quot;the empty place&quot;.&#39;,

                      &#39;of Fatigue every 4 hours without rest as well as [[1d4]] fire damage every [[1d2]] hours.\nAt a higher &#39;
                      &#39;Temperature you are instead subjected to the effects of Extreme Heat:\nOne Stack of Fatigue every 4 hours &#39;
